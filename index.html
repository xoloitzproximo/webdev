      Rene has been in the technology sector for four years. His introduction to
      technology was through the YEAR-UP program in Chicago where he enrolled as
      a student in 2017. This is a comprehensive training program in technology
      and professional development that requires dedication and perseverance
      from its students. The first six months of the program is divided into
      phases, including interpersonal relationship skill development and
      computer curriculum in Help-Desk and information security. This is
      followed by a six-month internship where students gain real life
      experience and exposure to other technology career professionals. As
      Alumni, YEAR-UP graduates can access additional career advice and
      educational training opportunities through a network of more than 20,000
      advisors and professional contacts. After completing the YEAR-UP program,
      Rene worked as a Tech Support Specialist for a staffing agency in downtown
      Chicago and has done contract work for Peapod E-Commerce Service Delivery.
      Rene also completed a certificate program at Northwestern University in
      Cybersecurity and has a CompTIA Security+ Certification. Rene is skilled
      in Windows, Linux and MAC-OS environments.
